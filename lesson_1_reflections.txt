How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

What do you thing are the pros and concs of manually choosing when to creat commits, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
I think the programmer usually has a better idea of when logical changes are being made to the code, so doing them manually is more appropriate, I think. 
Git log and Git diff commands can be used to view the commits and to see the changes made between two consequetive commits
